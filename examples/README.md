# Examples

Start a new consumer or adopt an existing tree. Each workspace below records exact
commands and expected evidence in its own `README.md`.

## Start From CI Templates

- [consumer-ci](consumer-ci/) starter caller for the reusable consumer workflow.
- [docs-ci](docs-ci/) starter caller for the reusable docs workflow.

## Adopt An Existing Tree

- [adopt-rust](adopt-rust/) foreign Cargo workspace adopted by `dx generate`.
- [adopt-python](adopt-python/) foreign Python tree adopted by the Python Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-js-ts](adopt-js-ts/) foreign JS/TS tree adopted by the JavaScript/TypeScript Gazelle extensions.
- [adopt-go](adopt-go/) foreign Go module adopted by the Go Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-cpp](adopt-cpp/) foreign C++ tree adopted by the C++ Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-java](adopt-java/) foreign Maven-layout tree adopted by the Java Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-kotlin](adopt-kotlin/) foreign Maven-layout tree adopted by the Kotlin Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-scala](adopt-scala/) foreign sbt-layout tree adopted by the Scala Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-csharp](adopt-csharp/) foreign SDK-style tree adopted by the C# Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-fsharp](adopt-fsharp/) foreign SDK-style tree adopted by the F# Gazelle extension.
- [adopt-polyglot](adopt-polyglot/) foreign Python+Rust+JS/TS tree adopted package by package.

`mixed/hello` is intentionally not indexed here: it is the mixed-framework
composition fixture (Vue/Svelte/Astro/MDX over one shared helper, owned by
the framework track), not an external-consumer workspace.

Per-foundation external-consumer workspaces plus acquisition/laziness proof are delivered (seed host; platform and remote dimensions are tracked in the roadmap).
