# Rust Merge And Cleanup

Verifies generated attribute refresh, user-owned attribute preservation, and conservative stale-rule cleanup.

Matrix: `merge` (source rename with rule/attribute/value `# keep`, unfamiliar attrs, stale lib+test removal), `binary` (binary refresh, unit-test wrapper merge, stale binary+test removal), `cargo_trim` (manifest-entry removal drops the stale test rule), `empty` (comment-only BUILD passes through unchanged).
