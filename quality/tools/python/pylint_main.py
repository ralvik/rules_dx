"""Pylint entry point with exit-code propagation (M15 WP3).

Upstream `py_console_script_binary` expands to `{fn}()` without `sys.exit`,
so pylint's bit-encoded return (1 fatal, 2 error, 4 warning, 8 refactor,
16 convention, 32 usage error) is dropped and every run exits 0. Quality
actions require the exit-code contract, so this wrapper preserves the
wheel-only graph and shared managed runtime while propagating the return
code. If `run_pylint` raises SystemExit itself, it propagates unchanged.
