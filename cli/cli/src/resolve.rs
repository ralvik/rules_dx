//! Scope resolution: labels, patterns, files, directories, and
//! test/coverage mapping (M08 WP1+WP2).
//!
//! Contract: `docs/cli/target-resolution.md#input-classification` and
//! `#file-ownership`. Main-workspace labels and target patterns pass
//! through after workspace validation; existing files resolve to every
//! direct source owner through one unconfigured `bazel query` invocation
//! per resolver call, with every file label quoted into a single
//! deterministic set and addressed by the nearest enclosing package;
//! directories become recursive Bazel patterns without
//! filesystem enumeration. This module never reads BUILD files and never
//! lists directories: the only filesystem calls are existence/kind probes
//! (`symlink_metadata`), and ownership facts come solely from Bazel
//! query stdout.
//!
//! Run/deploy resolution (`resolve_run`, `resolve_deploy`,
//! `check_deployable`) lives in the [`run_deploy`](self::run_deploy)
//! domain submodule (issue #236 resolve/plan/run/deploy unscramble,
//! handoff from issue #237); the public path stays
//! `crate::resolve::{...}` via the re-exports below. See the matching
//! note in `plan.rs` for the planning carve.
